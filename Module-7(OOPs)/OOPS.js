1. What is OOP?

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm (style of coding) where we organize code around objects instead of functions alone.
Objects = data (properties) + behavior (methods) packed together.

JavaScript supports OOP, but it’s a bit different because it’s prototype-based (not classical like Java or C++). Still, modern JS gives us classes to make OOP more familiar.
