1. What is OOP?

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm (style of coding) where we organize code around objects instead of functions alone.
Objects = data (properties) + behavior (methods) packed together.

JavaScript supports OOP, but it’s a bit different because it’s prototype-based (not classical like Java or C++). Still, modern JS gives us classes to make OOP more familiar.

Key Benefits of OOP in JavaScript

Code Reusability: Through inheritance and composition

Modularity: Organizing code into logical units
Maintainability: Easier to update and debug
Scalability: Better structure for large applications
Real-world Modeling: Objects represent real entities naturally

Modern JavaScript heavily embraces OOP principles, especially with ES6+ class syntax making it more familiar to developers from other OOP languages while maintaining JavaScript's flexible, prototype-based nature underneath.
